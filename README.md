FocusCore - Your Digital Discipline Engine
What is FocusCore?
FocusCore is not just an application; it is a declaration of war against distraction. It is a tool designed for one purpose: to create a pure, inescapable environment for deep work, study, or creation.
When you begin a session, FocusCore engages a "digital lockdown." It systematically terminates all unauthorized applications, background processes, and notifications. It blocks common escape routes like Alt+Tab and the Windows key, leaving you with only the tools you have explicitly permitted.
This is not a gentle reminder to stay on task. It is a locked door.
How It Works: The Lockdown
When you click "BEGIN SESSION," the following happens:
The Cage is Forged: Your screen is taken over by a minimalist interface that displays your session timer. This is your new reality.
The Purge Begins: The ProcessWatcher, the core of the system, scans all running applications. Anything that is not on your pre-approved "Whitelist" is instantly and mercilessly terminated. This includes browsers, chat apps, games, and background updaters.
The Gates are Sealed: A low-level KeyboardHook engages, disabling common key combinations used to escape or switch applications.
You are now in the Focus Zone. It is just you and your work.
The Two Paths to Freedom
A lockdown is useless without a clear objective. There are only two ways to end a session, each requiring a specific key combination.
1. The Path of Victory: Proof of Work (Ctrl + Alt + P)
This is the standard, successful way to end a session.
Press Ctrl + Alt + P.
A dialog will appear, prompting you to "Submit Proof of Work."
You must select a file that represents the work you accomplished during your session (e.g., a finished document, a piece of code, a design file).
Upon submission, the lockdown ends, and your session is logged as a Success.
2. The Path of Failure: Emergency Exit (Ctrl + Alt + E)
This path is for when you cannot complete your objective. It is an escape hatch, but it demands an admission of defeat.
Press Ctrl + Alt + E.
A dialog will appear, forcing you to type a reason for abandoning your session.
Upon confirmation, the lockdown ends, and your session is logged as a Failure.
The Admin Panel: Forging Your Rules
Before you can work effectively, you must define the rules of your work. The Admin Panel is your command center for this. Access it from the main screen before beginning a session.
It requires your password and must be run as an Administrator. If you are not an administrator, the application will ask for permission to restart with the correct privileges.
Inside the Admin Panel, you can:
Manage Your Whitelist: This is the most important feature. Use the "Analyze Executable..." button to select an application you need for your work (e.g., Photoshop.exe, Code.exe). The system will intelligently scan it and your computer, suggesting all the necessary helper processes and drivers (like NVIDIA or HP Omen services) that need to be whitelisted for it to run smoothly. Add these suggestions to your "Current Whitelist."
Change Your Password: Secure the Admin Panel with a new password.
Review Your History: View detailed logs of all past sessionsâ€”your successes, your failures, and your reasons for emergency exits.
Philosophy
In an age of constant digital noise, focus is a superpower. FocusCore is the training ground where you forge that power. It is intentionally strict because the forces of distraction are relentless. By creating an environment where the only path forward is to complete your work, you are not just finishing a task; you are building the discipline to conquer any challenge.
Enter the Focus Zone. Do the work. Emerge victorious.
